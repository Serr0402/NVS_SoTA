Information
===========

This is the PASCAL3D+ benchmark [1] for 3D object detection and pose estimation.
We augments 12 rigid categories of the PASCAL VOC 2012 [2] with 3D annotations.
Furthermore, more images are added to each category from ImageNet [3].
The annotations are in the .mat format of MATLAB.

For questions concerning the benchmark, please contact Yu Xiang at
<yuxiang AT umich DOT edu>.

This project has been supported by ONR grant N00014-13-1-0761 and NFS CAREER
grant #1054127.

Basic Usage
===========

There are four directories in this package:

1. Annotations. The augmented PASCAL annotations for the 12 categories.
2. Annotation_tool. The annotation tool for 3D annotation, and some scripts to visualize the annotations.
                    The scripts are helpful to understand the format of the annotation.
3. CAD. The CAD models used in the annotations.
4. Images. The PASCAL images in the 12 categories.


About this Release
==================
The current release only contains images from PASCAL VOC 2012. The ImageNet part will be released soon.
